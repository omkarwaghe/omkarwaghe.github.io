    <p><b>row level security</b></br>With row-level security, users can have access to a table without having access to all rows on that table
  </br> to apply row level security you can add view with SQL condition in record properties of the record which you want to apply row level security
  </br>To implement row-level security through a security view:

  </br>In Application Designer, insert one of the three row-level security fields (OPRID, OPRCLASS, ROWSECCLASS) into the record definition.

  </br>Configure the field as a Key, but not a List Box Item.

  </br>Save the record and build the view.

  </br>Use the record as the search record or query security record.

  </br>Now, when the user searches, the system dynamically adds a WHERE clause — that incorporates the security field — to the search SELECT statement. The value of the security field is based on the current user.
