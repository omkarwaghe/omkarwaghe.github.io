</br>Step-by-Step Guide
</br>reate Data Source in Application Engine:

</br>Develop an Application Engine program to extract data from the PeopleSoft database.
</br>Use SQL or PeopleCode to fetch the required data and store it in a temporary table or a state record.
</br>Register Data Source in BI Publisher:

</br>Navigate to Reporting Tools > BI Publisher > Data Source.
</br>Register the data source created by your Application Engine program.
</br>Design BI Publisher Report Template:

</br>Use tools like Microsoft Word with the BI Publisher plugin to design your report template.
</br>Define the layout and format of the report, and map the data fields from your data source to the template.
</br>Upload and Register the Template:

</br>Go to Reporting Tools > BI Publisher > Report Definition.
</br>Create a new report definition and upload your template.
</br>Link the data source to the report definition.
</br>Configure Application Engine to Call BI Publisher:

</br>In your Application Engine program, add a PeopleCode step to call the BI Publisher report.
</br>Use the XML Publisher API to generate the report. Example PeopleCode snippet:
<p>
</br>import PSXP_RPTDEFNMANAGER:*;
</br>Local PSXP_RPTDEFNMANAGER:ReportDefn &ReportDefn;
</br>&ReportDefn = create PSXP_RPTDEFNMANAGER:ReportDefn("REPORT_DEFN_ID");
</br>&ReportDefn.SetRuntimeDataXML(&XMLDoc);
</br>&ReportDefn.ProcessReport("", "");
</br>Schedule and Run the Application Engine:
</p>
</br>Schedule the Application Engine program using Process Scheduler.
</br>Ensure the program runs at the desired intervals to generate and distribute the reports.

    </p>
    <p><b>row level security</b></br>With row-level security, users can have access to a table without having access to all rows on that table
  </br> to apply row level security you can add view with SQL condition in record properties of the record which you want to apply row level security
  <p>
  </br>To implement row-level security through a security view:

  </br>In Application Designer, insert one of the three row-level security fields (OPRID, OPRCLASS, ROWSECCLASS) into the record definition.

  </br>Configure the field as a Key, but not a List Box Item.

  </br>Save the record and build the view.

  </br>Use the record as the search record or query security record.

  </br>Now, when the user searches, the system dynamically adds a WHERE clause — that incorporates the security field — to the search SELECT statement. The value of the security field is based on the current user.
  </p>
    <p><b>Query Access Group</b></br> Every record definition that you want users to be able to query must be in a query tree.</p>
