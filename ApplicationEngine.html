  <br>One PSDAEMON process can run for each row in the PS_SERVERDEFN table. The PS_SERVERDEFN.DAEMONENABLED field must be set to 1.

  </br>Parts of application Engine are <ol><li>Section</li><li>Step</li><li>Actions</li></ol> 
  <p>App engine properties</br></p>
  <ol><li>Disable restart</br>select to disable built-in restart capabilities for program</li>
  <li>Application Library</br>delcare some program to contain only a collection or library</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    <b>Section</b></br>
    MAIN section identifies the entry point of the program.
    <p><b>Important Section Properties</b>
      <ol><li>Market- select the market for which the section is intended</li>
      <li>Platform - select the target database for which this section definition will run</li>
      <li>Effective Date</li><li>Effective status</li><li>Section type - If the program terminate abnormally,
        this value specifies if you want to restart the program or not</br> If a section controls a procedure that, if not run to completion, 
        could corrupt or desynchronize your data, then select Critical Updates. Otherwise, accept the default value of Prepare Only.</li>
        <li>Auto commit - no commit or commit after step is completed in the section</li>
        <li>Access - if set to public the section can be accessed by another program</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p><b>Step</b></p>
    </br>Step is the smallest unit of work that can be commited in the program.
    <br>Important Step properties
    <ul><li> Commit -
Specify the commit level for the step:
<ul><li>Default: Select to inherit whatever commit level you specified for the section in which the step resides.</li>
<li>Later: Select to postpone the commit until a subsequent commit occurs. Here you can override the section-level commit if it is set to After Step.</li>
<li>After Step: Select if you have a commit level of None specified at the section level.<br>This selection enables you to override the section-level commit and commit a specific step within a section with no other commits.</li>
</ul>
    </li>
      <li>Frequency - Enabled only when a step contains Do While, Do Select or Do Until. </br>Enter the numeric frequency at which App engine should commit</li>
      <li>On Error <br> <ul><li>Abort - Application teminate with error message</li><li>Ignore - program continues but logs an error message</li>
        <li>Suppress - The program continues and present no error message</ul></li>
      <li> Status - Set to activate step</li>
    </ul>
    </p> 
    <p><b>Actions</b></p>
    <ul>
  <li>Do Actions
  </br><ul><li>Do When - A Do When statement runs before any other actions in a step. If the Do When statement returns any rows, the next action is executed. 
  </br>If the Do When conditions are not met, the remaining actions within that step are not executed</li><li>Do While -  runs before subsequent actions of the step. If the Do While statement does not return any rows of data, the action terminates. The Do While statement is identical to the COBOL While statement. 
  </br>Subsequent actions within the step are executed in a loop as long as at least one row is returned by the Select statement for the Do While action. If the Do While statement does not return any rows, the step is complete.</li><Li>Do Select -a Do Select statement can run a SQL statement for each row returned from the Select statement. The subsequent actions within the step are executed in a loop based on the results of the Select statement. The type of the Do Select determines the specific looping rules.</li><li>Do Until - A Do Until action is a Select statement that runs after each action when a step completes
  </br>You use a Do Until action if you want the processing actions to execute at least once and to execute repeatedly until a certain condition is true, such as a Select statement returns some rows</li></ul></li>

      <b>Using CallAppEngine</b></br>
       you may need to firstly check the App Engine to see what its requirements are in terms of run control records. If a run control record is needed, a better option would be to create the run control record and then schedule an App Engine process via ‘CreateProcessRequest’</br>
      If the App Engine does have the ability to be run immediately as part of online PeopleCode, you also need to consider what database tables must be populated in advance. If, for instance, the user is mid-way through processing data on a component, you will need to consider the most appropriate place to call the App Engine. You may have to perform an early ‘DoSave()’ before continuing with ‘CallAppEngine’. Therefore, a likely event to include a ‘CallAppEngine’ statement would be ‘FieldChange’ or ‘SavePostChange’</br>
    <p>
      /* Set the state record for the App Engine */</br>
Local Record &stateRec;</br>
 
&stateRec = CreateRecord(Record.STATE_REC_AET);</br>
&stateRec.EMPLID.Value = ¤tEmplID;</br>
&stateRec.ITEM_TYPE.Value = ¤tItemType;</br>
 
CallAppEngine("APP_ENG", &stateRec);</br>
    </p>
         
  </p>
    <p>
    <b>State Records of Called Programs</b><br>
      When you call a program from another program, the default state record of the called program becomes active until processing returns to the initial program. However, all of the state records associated with both programs are available. State records that are common between the two programs share values. To communicate between the two programs or share %BIND variables, define the same state records in both programs.
      </p>
    <p>
      <b>Using CallAppEngine</b></br>
      Many App Engine programs are developed under the assumption that a run control record is populated in advance, and that the AE will only be run via the Process Scheduler. Therefore, you may need to firstly check the App Engine to see what its requirements are in terms of run control records. If a run control record is needed, a better option would be to create the run control record and then schedule an App Engine process via ‘CreateProcessRequest’

    <p><b>Meta-SQL and PeopleCode</b></br>
  <ul><li><b>%UpdateStats</b> - use this construct to generate platform specific SQL statement that update the system catalog tables used by database optimizer in choosing optimal query plans</br>
  Use this construct after your program has inserted large amounts of data into a temporary table that will be deleted before the end of the program run. This construct saves you from having to use dummy seed data for the temporary table and having to update statistics manually.
  <br> Syntax %UpdateStats(<i>Tablename</i>, [HIGH/LOW])</li>
    <li><b>%Truncate</b> - truncates an expression to a specified scale before or after the decimal point.<br>
    Syntax - %Truncate(<i>table name</i>)
    Example - %Truncate(10.337, 2) = 10.33, %Truncate(19.337, -1) = 10</li>
    <li><b>%TruncateTable</b> - Use the %TruncateTable construct to invoke a bulk delete command on a table. It perform Implicit commit and This construct is functionally identical to a Delete SQL statement with no Where clause, but it is faster on databases that support bulk deletes. </br>
    Syntax - %TruncateTable(table name)
    <li><b>%Select</b> - use to pass the variables to the state records
    <b>%select</b> and <b>%selectinit</b> are same when they are retrivng values.when it comes to %select when it is not retriving values the previous values in the state record will be unchanged.when it comes to %selectinit when it is not retriving values the previous values in the state record will be changed to Null.
    </li>
    <li><b>%COALESCE</b> - use this function to return non-null argument provided to the function</br>
    The NULL values are replaced with the user-given value during the expression value evaluation process</br>
    </li>
    <li><b>%CurrentDateTimeIn and %CurrentDateTimeOut </b> are the case where TimeIn are used in SQL with where clause select,update,insert statement</li>
    <li><b>%DateIn</b> - wherever date literal or date bind variable is used in a comparison in the Where clause of a select or update or insert statement</br>
    in COBOL you can only use String literal.
  </li>
