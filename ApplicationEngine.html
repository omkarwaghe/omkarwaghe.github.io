    <ol><li>Standard</li><li>Upgrade</li><li>Import</li><li>Daemon - It runs continously when Peoplesoft Process scheduler is running and is intended for recurring jobs
  <br>One PSDAEMON process can run for each row in the PS_SERVERDEFN table. The PS_SERVERDEFN.DAEMONENABLED field must be set to 1.
  <br> Start Daemon process from PeopleTools>Process Scheduler>Daemon Group</li>

  </br>Parts of application Engine are <ol><li>Section</li><li>Step</li><li>Actions</li></ol> 
  <p>App engine properties</br></p>
  <ol><li>Disable restart</br>select to disable built-in restart capabilities for program</li>
  <li>Application Library</br>delcare some program to contain only a collection or library</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    <b>Section</b></br>
    MAIN section identifies the entry point of the program.
    <p><b>Important Section Properties</b>
      <ol><li>Market- select the market for which the section is intended</li>
      <li>Platform - select the target database for which this section definition will run</li>
      <li>Effective Date</li><li>Effective status</li><li>Section type - If the program terminate abnormally,
        this value specifies if you want to restart the program or not</br> If a section controls a procedure that, if not run to completion, 
        could corrupt or desynchronize your data, then select Critical Updates. Otherwise, accept the default value of Prepare Only.</li>
        <li>Auto commit - no commit or commit after step is completed in the section</li>
        <li>Access - if set to public the section can be accessed by another program</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p><b>Step</b></p>
    </br>Step is the smallest unit of work that can be commited in the program.
    <br>Important Step properties
    <ul><li> Commit -
Specify the commit level for the step:
<ul><li>Default: Select to inherit whatever commit level you specified for the section in which the step resides.</li>
<li>Later: Select to postpone the commit until a subsequent commit occurs. Here you can override the section-level commit if it is set to After Step.</li>
<li>After Step: Select if you have a commit level of None specified at the section level.<br>This selection enables you to override the section-level commit and commit a specific step within a section with no other commits.</li>
</ul>
    </li>
      <li>Frequency - Enabled only when a step contains Do While, Do Select or Do Until. </br>Enter the numeric frequency at which App engine should commit</li>
      <li>On Error <br> <ul><li>Abort - Application teminate with error message</li><li>Ignore - program continues but logs an error message</li>
        <li>Suppress - The program continues and present no error message</ul></li>
      <li> Status - Set to activate step</li>
    </ul>
    </p> 
    <p><b>Actions</b></p>
    <ul>
  <li>Do Actions
  </br><ul><li>Do When - A Do When statement runs before any other actions in a step. If the Do When statement returns any rows, the next action is executed. 
  </br>If the Do When conditions are not met, the remaining actions within that step are not executed</li><li>Do While -  runs before subsequent actions of the step. If the Do While statement does not return any rows of data, the action terminates. The Do While statement is identical to the COBOL While statement. 
  </br>Subsequent actions within the step are executed in a loop as long as at least one row is returned by the Select statement for the Do While action. If the Do While statement does not return any rows, the step is complete.</li><Li>Do Select -a Do Select statement can run a SQL statement for each row returned from the Select statement. The subsequent actions within the step are executed in a loop based on the results of the Select statement. The type of the Do Select determines the specific looping rules.</li><li>Do Until - A Do Until action is a Select statement that runs after each action when a step completes
  </br>You use a Do Until action if you want the processing actions to execute at least once and to execute repeatedly until a certain condition is true, such as a Select statement returns some rows</li></ul></li>
